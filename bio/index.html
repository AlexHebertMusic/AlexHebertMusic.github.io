          Alex Hébert (b. 2006) is a percussionist and composer based in College Station, 
          TX. He is currently a Freshman at Texas A&M University studying applied mathematics
          and computer science. With a background in piano, he reunited with music 
          during high school and began composing for the marimba. <br> <br>
          As a composer, Alex is deeply inspired by telling a story through music.
          His debut piece, Dragon's Hiraeth, traverses the themes
          of longing and adventure through this musical storytelling. He is working on
          blending the modern styles of his favorite composers for the goal of creating
          more inspiration and awareness for marimba composers and expanding marimba repertoire. <br> <br>
          As a performer, although he has no formal experience (yet), he has performed 
          for audiences such as Dr. Brad Meyer at Stephen F. Austin University, earning a
          1 at state competition, the highest score. He is still dedicated to honing his craft 
          and sharing his music on stage one day. <br> <br>
          Besides music, Alex enjoys teaching and studying mathematics as well as 
          programming.
